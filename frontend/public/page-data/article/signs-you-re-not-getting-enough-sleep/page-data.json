The truth is that even if you cannot get 8 hours, you should aim for 6. Lack of sleep can be utterly disastrous in the long run, and that's why you need to develop healthy sleeping habits. The elders say, 'acknowledging your flaw is the first step to getting better' to develop better sleeping habits, you must first recognize the issue. Here are some signs you might not be getting enough sleep;\n* You are prone to mood swings-Sleep and your emotional health are more connected than you might think. On a short-term basis, not sleeping enough could lead to more aggression and irritation, which would ultimately damage your relationships and difficulty handling stress. Haven't you ever wondered why you've woken up abruptly, you snap more, and it's more difficult for you to crack a smile or why after a short night's rest, seemingly little situations stress you out more than necessary?\nIf you can relate to the instances above, you might not be getting enough sleep.\n* You are ticking off less of your task list- As a part of time management and making the most of your day, you probably have a to-do list with activities you have to tick off by the hour. There are many reasons why you might not be ticking your activities off as fast as you should, but if your excuse is that you're too slow and lack the energy to carry you out the tasks, that might be an indicator that you aren't resting well enough.\n* Your eyes tell you that you're tired- sleep is more important than we believe it is, and it plays a part in all aspects of our life, appearance inclusive. Have your eyes started to become redder over the days (As though you've been in the water for a long time), or are they puffy, or are you starting to notice your eye bags become very prominent? If someone had to describe you to a waiter at an 'Owambe,' would your tired eyes be the quality described right after your beautiful outfit?\nIf you notice all of these signs, you might want to consider sleeping some more\nTo sleep better, you might want to do the following things;\n* Take a shower before bed, whether a warm or cold bath; they both have the same soothing effect that would help you have a good night's rest.\n* Put down your phone! As tempting as it is, please do not look through your social media right before bed. It's always 'just five minutes' until its 4:30 am.","publishedAt":"2020-09-11T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/dff4711a9b085c4b6cf2c01e15eb2674/4909675b2c6cdd55ffd7f4cc48b8358b.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/dff4711a9b085c4b6cf2c01e15eb2674/2244e/4909675b2c6cdd55ffd7f4cc48b8358b.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Uche Olise","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/af6e46463b1cbc12d42aa789056baec3/58a4b/8c69e0b13791ed1d0a8ad798ecbac531.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"signs-you-re-not-getting-enough-sleep"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
