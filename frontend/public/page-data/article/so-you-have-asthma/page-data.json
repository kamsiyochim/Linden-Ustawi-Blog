This disease makes it difficult to breathe and triggers coughing and wheezing (a whistling sound) due to shortness of breath.\nCommon Symptoms of Asthma include:\n1. Wheezing: This is by far the most common symptom of Asthma and is simply a whistling sound one makes when one breathes.\n2. Shortness of Breath\n3. Talking becomes difficult\n4. Tiredness\n5. Tightness in one's chest\nThere are various kinds of Asthma that are due to a range of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. These include:\n1. Allergic Asthma: This type of Asthma is triggered by allergens like pests (cockroaches for instance), mold, food, pollen and dust. It is usually seasonal so the person suffering from it may also suffer from other seasonal allergies as well.\n2. Non-allergic Asthma: This is not related to allergies and is instead caused by air pollution, like cigarette smoke and burning wood. It can also be triggered by different viral illnesses, domestic cleaning products and even air fresheners!\n3. Bronchial Asthma: This is the most common type of Asthma affecting the bronchi of the lungs which leads to swelling of the lungs and constriction of the airways (This is the asthma that people are referring to when talking about the disease).\n4. Exercised-induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB): This type of Asthma occurs just as individuals begin exercise and even ten minutes after the exercise is completed.\nTreatment\nAlthough Asthma has no cure right now, all hope isn't lost as there are many quick relief medications one can take if one is suffering from the condition. These medications are called bronchodilators and they help to clear the mucus from the lungs to improve airflow. Beta2-agonists such as Epinephrine and metaproterenol (Alupent) help to reduce the impact of Allergic reactions which cause Asthma.\nThinking long term, the daily use of an anti-inflammatory drug like inhaled corticosteroids will help with Asthma relief. Note that these drugs should be used following your doctor's guidelines.\nLook Asthma when not effectively handled can potentially be life threatening so to avoid getting to that point, taking your medications on a regular basis will help you manage the conditions so you can enjoy life to the fullest.","publishedAt":"2020-10-02T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/c21e7265249a6cacef09b5b397fc7a56/09dfa1050817d9ead5d5e373d51d5af8.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/c21e7265249a6cacef09b5b397fc7a56/0396c/09dfa1050817d9ead5d5e373d51d5af8.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Osemedua Iwelumo","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/4489746858ca16439587b8d750210628/58a4b/9eda74f432b08f32f58959bb8f882a03.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"so-you-have-asthma"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
