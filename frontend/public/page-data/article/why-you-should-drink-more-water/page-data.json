For real though, water comes with many health benefits that simply cannot be ignored:\n1. For the aesthetically minded among us, water is believed to help with the smoothness of our skin as our largest organ is comprised of at least thirty percent water.\n2. Drinking water regularly also helps the kidney get rid of toxins more effectively as urine flows more easily when there's more water in our system.\n3. Water also helps to raise our moods and energy level, ultimately resulting in greater productivity as many studies note that even mild dehydration lowers brain performance.\n4. Everyone likes a good party and that usually comes with lots and I mean lots of alcohol. Water consumption helps to combat those terrible hangovers after a great night out that ordinarily would leave you disoriented throughout the day.\n5. Water also helps to strengthen our body by lubricating our joints which helps with shock absorption from external environments and keeping us oxygenated as blood is mostly water and responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.\nWater doesn't just have to be taken in it's purely liquid form as it can also be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. Women are advised to drink at least 91 ounces of water day while men are to take 125 ounces daily but of course these amounts depend on your lifestyle.","publishedAt":"2020-09-08T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/a60a0e678da9dc9f78467c8853c59706/54a2f0ee2df67cbd388495ba6b261dc6.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/a60a0e678da9dc9f78467c8853c59706/2244e/54a2f0ee2df67cbd388495ba6b261dc6.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Osemedua Iwelumo","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/4489746858ca16439587b8d750210628/58a4b/9eda74f432b08f32f58959bb8f882a03.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-you-should-drink-more-water"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
