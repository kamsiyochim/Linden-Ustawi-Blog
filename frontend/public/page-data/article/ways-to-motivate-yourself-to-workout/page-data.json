With that in mind, here are some tips to get you ready to burn those calories!","content":"When scrolling through Instagram (or any other form of social media), we see images of girls or guys who look in shape and really healthy. From that moment, we make up our minds to work towards that.\nThis is great and all, but honestly, it's easier said than done.\nTake me for example, some days I'm really motivated to exercise and other days I'm just not in the mood. But I realized it's important to stick with that workout routine because it's really good for my health and overall wellbeing.\nSo because of this, I decided to list and explain different ways to motivate myself to get that blood pumping.\nFirst, dress the part. Research shows that our brains are susceptible to \"enclothed cognition\". This is basically a technical way of saying dressing the part can motivate you to do some exercise to encourage your body to stay healthy. This really helps even when you're not feeling up to it, so it's not so easy to give up. Since you're already in your workout clothes, you might as well get started.\n\n2. Second, get up early. Getting up early in the morning helps you stay focused and by getting up early, you won't be able to talk yourself out of exercising. Plus exercise is really energizing and helps you start your day. But if you don't get up early, you might be too tired to do anything energetic and before you know it, you might forget all about your target.\n3. Set realistic goals. You need to be gentle with yourself when setting body goals (or any other goals). You have to be realistic and not set goals that cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Also, don't be hard on yourself. If you set a realistic goal and you didn't quite get it, don't beat yourself up about it. You need to know that this is a gradual process and you WILL get there. Just keep going at your pace and you will be fine.\n4. Workout with a friend. It's always encouraging to work out with a friend. This way, you won't feel like you are along on your fitness journey instead it'll feel like you're just spending time with friends. It also makes it fun. Sometimes we can get a bit tense and eager when working out. This is totally normal because we are just anxious to reach our goal. But when you exercise with a close friend, someone who is just as dedicated as you are, it takes some of the tension and anxiety off and you guys can have a blast while exercising.\nSo these are few ways to motivate yourself to exercise and stay healthy and fit. You could try them out and see the results :)","publishedAt":"2020-10-06T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/1efe752cee788fde7da900876db53d4e/072137bad4bbc401526fff29be4d682a.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/1efe752cee788fde7da900876db53d4e/2244e/072137bad4bbc401526fff29be4d682a.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Safa Kadiri","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/60a0e3f7555bad8232e20ee93c8c1b10/58a4b/0be5a70080d1ebd8ef057624023b04dd.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ways-to-motivate-yourself-to-workout"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
