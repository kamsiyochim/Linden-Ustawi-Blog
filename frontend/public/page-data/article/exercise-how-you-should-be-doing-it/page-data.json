I'd like to let you in on a little secret, you do not have to go to the gym to get some exercise done (I know right? That's between us.)\nIt is important to have between 30 and 60 minutes of mild to moderate exercise, here's how you do it;\n*Pace while you answer the phone- With working from home being a part of the new reality don't be afraid to take walks around your room or apartment while you take work calls. By doing that you easily add more steps to your step count without breaking a sweat.\n*Make your chores as physical as possible- On the weekend when you have to do chores at home make your speaker your best friend and dance while you do laundry or vacuum your house, even if you're not a dancer no one would ever know. What's better than spontaneous dance parties? Dance parties where no one can see your two left feet at work.\nIn line with making your tasks more physical, anything could act as homemade weights, while you take the case of water up the stairs you can tone your arms and if you sneak in a couple of squats your be toning your legs too. Get creative anything can count as a work out.\n* Park far away from the door- There is every temptation to part as close to the door as possible but if you wouldn't be caught at a gym, you might want to add more steps to your daily routine and that includes parking as far from the entrance as you can.\n* Use the stairs- I know you already saw this coming; you can't run from the truth (I don't hate being the bearer of this news). You have to use the lifts and escalators less and take the stairs more. Is your office on the 7th floor? Well that's even better, you might want to start early and don't think of using the lifts half way (mama always knows)\nExercise does not have to be as stressful as people make it out to be so you don't have to stress and it's even better when how much exercise you put in isn't determined by your bank account. You can start small and work your way to more difficult terrain.\nWould exercise then become addictive like Instagram models say? Let us know when you try it out!","publishedAt":"2020-09-22T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/7405150312bc5b9f0e9d3e0cd472b9b3/997d9a4d4677b37602a67e54469e1d40.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/7405150312bc5b9f0e9d3e0cd472b9b3/2244e/997d9a4d4677b37602a67e54469e1d40.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Uche Olise","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/af6e46463b1cbc12d42aa789056baec3/58a4b/8c69e0b13791ed1d0a8ad798ecbac531.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"exercise-how-you-should-be-doing-it"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
