Try switching things up a little.\nOr if you prefer curling up in a blanket to watch a movie that's cool too. Just do what you feel can improve your mood tbh.\nBut if that doesn't work, you could change the normal way you do things. For example, if you work from home from 9am till 5pm, try not to stay cooped up in one place for hours.\nGet some fresh air.\nTake a walk. It's needed.\nThe best part about walking is that you can go on for as long as you like. It doesn't have to be a loooong walk. It can be any kind of walk you like. The point of this is to clear your mind, leaving you feeling refined and lighter.\nJust try it out and you'll see if this works for you.\nAlso, try not to stay isolated for too long. Although some people prefer this, but if you're the social type, make sure to take a few breaks in between work to catch up with friends.\nLeave that work space and go somewhere were you know your friends are. You can just gist with your guys and once you feel better, you can get back to work and even get more ideas in whatever you were working on.\nAlso remember to EAT.\nFood is veryyyyy essential. You know the saying \"A hungry man is an angry man\"? Well this is very true. Some people get cranky when they haven't eaten. To avoid this, ensure you eat a three square meal every day.\nSkipping meals or not eating at the appropriate times all in the name of work can cause all sorts of diseases and health conditions.\nAnother way to switch things up is to read a book. It can be any genre of your choice. Reading books can be really relaxing and helps improve your vocabulary. This can be handy whenever you're writing a report or something and you want to impress the lecturer with your grammar.\nI'm not saying you pick up one kind of big educational book o! Lol. It can just be novels or any genre you enjoy tbh.\nYou could read books in airy places as this adds to the calming effect it brings.\nJust try a few of these ways to switch things up to see if it will improve your mood.","publishedAt":"2020-09-15T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/3cae5df5420238a4ca9fdaa54808156d/c61bc7ef5a9bfa29eb4d3de605927489.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/3cae5df5420238a4ca9fdaa54808156d/2244e/c61bc7ef5a9bfa29eb4d3de605927489.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Safa Kadiri","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/60a0e3f7555bad8232e20ee93c8c1b10/58a4b/0be5a70080d1ebd8ef057624023b04dd.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ways-to-switch-up-your-routine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
